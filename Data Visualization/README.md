# Data Analysis and Visualization — Treasury Yield Curves & Titanic Dataset

This project provides hands‑on experience in data analysis and visualization using Pandas and Seaborn. It is divided into two parts: analyzing Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates to understand interest rate trends, and exploring the Titanic dataset to practice exploratory data analysis on real‑world structured data. Together, these tasks build foundational skills in time series analysis, data wrangling, and visual storytelling.

---

## **Purpose**

This assignment helps students develop practical skills in:

- Time series analysis  
- Data wrangling and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib  
- Interpreting patterns and communicating insights  

By working with two distinct datasets, students gain experience analyzing both financial time series and demographic/survival data.

## **Tasks Overview**

This assignment consists of two major parts, each designed to strengthen your ability to analyze, visualize, and interpret real‑world datasets.

---

## **Part 1: Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates Visualization**

In this part, you will analyze the Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates dataset to observe how interest rates change over time. Each column represents a different maturity period (e.g., 1‑month, 2‑year, 10‑year), and each row corresponds to a trading day.

### **What to Do**

1. Load the yield curve data into a Pandas DataFrame.  
2. Clean and preprocess the data as needed (e.g., handle missing values, convert date columns).  
3. Create at least three meaningful visualizations using Seaborn or Matplotlib, such as:  
   - Line plots showing how specific yields (e.g., 2‑year and 10‑year) changed over time  
   - Heatmaps of yield spreads across dates and maturities  
   - Comparisons between short‑term and long‑term yields  
4. Provide brief interpretations for each visualization to highlight key observations.

## **Part 2: Titanic Dataset Exploration**

In this part, you will perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns in passenger demographics and survival outcomes.

### **What to Do**

1. Load the built‑in Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.  
2. Perform basic data cleaning if necessary (e.g., handling missing values).  
3. Use Seaborn to create at least three visualizations exploring variables such as:  
   - Survival rate by passenger class  
   - Age distribution by survival  
   - Survival rate by gender  
4. Write brief observations or insights for each visualization.
